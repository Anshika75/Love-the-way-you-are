# Love the way you are
It's truly said there is no definition of beauty as "Everything has its own beauty but not Everyone sees it"

Love makes the world go round, but self-love is where it starts! Love yourself first and everything else falls into line. You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing.


NOTE: It still needs improvement and has an issue of lagging after some 😓 and to add on I am unable to get the solution to the problem 🥺 but I still have my hopes turned on and I am still trying to get a solution to my problem Hopefully will solve it🤞
